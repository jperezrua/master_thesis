\chapter{Object Flow Pipeline} \label{chap:core}
Following the definition of the problem given in the Section \ref{sec:definition}, a 
 system for computing the object flow have been devised. 
 This system is composed of three  main steps, which will be explained in short.  
 
\section{Algorithm description}
\label{sec:desc}

Fig. \ref{figurelabel_sys} shows a simplified block diagram of the proposed system. It is important to recognize the two main 
components of our work-flow: object tracking and segmentation, and pixel-wise flow computation on the pixels of interest.  The scheme is completed by feeding back the flow 
information to improve the tracker as depicted in the figure. For instance, one can make the most of dense displacement vectors to refine the motion of the target, and 
the segmentation information can be used to improve the sampling process of the learning stage in several trackers by detection methods \cite{c22}. Thus, 
the tracker and motion flow algorithm can work for mutual enhancement.

 The object tracking in the object flow pipeline can be selected according to a specific need for a given application. Here, recent methods based on tracking-by-detection are preferred, given that they are in the top of modern benchmarks for object tracking \cite{c16} in terms of accuracy and stability to initialization changes. Even more, as previously mentioned 
tracking-by-detection techniques benefit from the background-foreground separation of the next stage in the object flow pipeline. For instance, the sampling process in the {\it Struck} 
tracker can be improved by selecting positive samples only inside the region of the target object.
In the second place, for the object segmentation in video, the 
labelled background regions through the concept of superpixel flow, as explained in 
Section \ref{chap:suppix}, is shown. The last step, the flow computation, uses a modified 
{\it Simple Flow} algorithm, which uses the provided segmentation masks for an accurate estimation.
