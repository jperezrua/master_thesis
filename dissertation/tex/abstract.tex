\begin{abstract}
Motion analysis in image sequences has undoubtedly shown good 
progress in terms of its two main research branches. 
Optical flow estimation and object visual tracking have been 
mostly studied as isolated problems, and high accuracy algorithms 
are available when needed as independent bricks. 
This thesis presents a framework for combining object tracking 
techniques with optical flow methods aiming towards a precise 
motion description for objects in video sequences. 
Firstly, we introduce a method to segment objects in videos, which is done 
by exploiting the inherent foreground-background 
separation hints given by object trackers, and the novel concept 
of superpixel flow, which is used to perform background regions tracking. 
Then, it is shown that long-motion awareness obtained from object 
tracking, together with a per frame object segmentation can 
improve the precision of the object motion description in 
comparison to several optical flow techniques. 
The proposed approach is called Object flow as it offers a 
dense description of the current apparent motion state 
of the studied object.
