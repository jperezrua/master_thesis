\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in motion analysis in image sequences
have shown undoubtedly impressive progresses. Among
them, dense (i.e. for every pixel of the image) optical flow
estimation and per-object visual tracking are fundamental
still-open problems and, as independent bricks in the
computer vision toolbox, high accuracy algorithms are at
hand. However, combining such challenges in a unified
framework solution remains an unexplored terrain.
Thus, the present work aims towards the posibility of
exploiting robust object tracking algorithms for boosting per
pixel motion estimation. And, subsequently, to find out if
a semantic (high-level) decomposition of the scene together 
with a (low-level) motion characterization, would permit
advanced operations in a per-object basis.
