%ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in motion analysis in image sequences
have shown undoubtedly impressive progresses. Among
them, dense (i.e. for every pixel of the image) optical flow
estimation and per-object visual tracking are fundamental
still-open problems and, as independent bricks in the
computer vision toolbox, high accuracy algorithms are at
hand. However, combining such challenges in a unified
framework solution remains an unexplored terrain.
