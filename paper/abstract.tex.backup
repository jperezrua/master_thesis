Among the state of the art segmentation methods for objects in video
sequences, point trajectories based ones stand for its performance and 
reliability. In the other hand, for the problem of extracting out a 
preselected object in still frames, max-flow min-cut based approaches
 have demostrated to be a powerful tool. We propose to mix these two
 ideas for reliable object segmentation in video. Moreover, in this paper
 we introduce the superpixel flow method for region tracking

Superpixels and over segmentation techniques
became a widely used pre-processing stage for a
large number of machine vision applications, after the
original concept was introduced \cite{c1}. Superpixels are
traditionally used as performance booster for several
other techniques. However, it is still mostly related to
single frame processing \cite{c1}\cite{c10}\cite{c11}. In the search for
consistency in superpixel labeling through video,
some authors have proposed different techniques,
which go from simple extension to supervoxels\cite{c9}\cite{c11},
to more complicated approaches \cite{c8}. These
approaches, nonetheless, usually require a global
processing and knowledge of all (or several of) the
video frames beforehand. In this paper we propose a superpixel
matching technique which assumes a flowlike
behavior in the image sequences (natural video), and
propose an application for improving object segmentation in videos.
