\section{Conclusions}

A framework to combine tracking and optical flow methods to improve 
object based dense motion description is presented. The pipeline is 
composed of three main steps, object tracking, segmentation and 
flow estimation. For the segmentation step a new video object 
segmentation algorithm was proposed and some results are shown. 
The last step, flow estimation is a modification of the simple-flow method to use 
the obtained segmentation mask.
The experiments showed that the object flow improves the dense motion 
estimation in comparisson to optical flow techniques.
Future work includes the use of different optical flow techniques as base of the object flow. Also, 
applications of the object flow in the structure-from-motion pipeline, or for automatic video edition can be 
more deeply studied.



%A method for superpixel matching in a flow-like
%behavior had been presented. We may call it superpixel propagation, or super-pixel flow. This
%technique shows robustness in the labeling of the
%matches, and seems to be able to improve the results
%for object segmentation in video sequences when
%using the Grab-cut algorithm. Another motivation for
%this technique, however may be as initialization of
%optical flow techniques, to obtain more robust results
%due to a good initial guess for energy minimization
%methods. This has to be looked at more deeply in future work.
