\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A method for super-pixel matching in a flow-like
behavior had been presented. We may call it superpixel propagation, or super-pixel flow. This
technique shows robustness in the labeling of the
matches, and seems to be able to improve the results
for object segmentation in video sequences when
using the Grab-cut algorithm. Another motivation for
this technique, however may be as initialization of
optical flow techniques, to obtain more robust results
due to a good initial guess for energy minimization
methods. This has to be looked at more deeply in future work.
