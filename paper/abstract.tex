Among the state of the art segmentation methods for objects in video
sequences, point trajectories based ones stand for its performance and 
reliability, even when only sparse trajectories are known because of
computational reasons. In the other hand, for the problem of extracting out a 
preselected object in still frames, max-flow min-cut based approaches
 have demostrated to be a powerful tool. We propose to mix these two
 ideas for reliable object segmentation through video. Moreover, in this paper
 we introduce the superpixel flow method for tracking of background regions,
 rather than sparse points. We show how this extra information
 can be used to expand the max-flow min-cut techniques for an
 efficient foregorund-background segmentation. Experiments on
 several video sequences demostrate the characteristics of the proposed
 method.
