Superpixels and over segmentation techniques
became a widely used pre-processing stage for a
large number of machine vision applications, after the
original concept was introduced \cite{c1}. Superpixels are
traditionally used as performance booster for several
other techniques. However, it is still mostly related to
single frame processing \cite{c1}\cite{c10}\cite{c11}. In the search for
consistency in superpixel labeling through video,
some authors have proposed different techniques,
which go from simple extension to supervoxels\cite{c9}\cite{c11},
to more complicated approaches \cite{c8}. These
approaches, nonetheless, usually require a global
processing and knowledge of all (or several of) the
video frames beforehand. In this paper we propose a superpixel
matching technique which assumes a flowlike
behavior in the image sequences (natural video), and
propose an application for improving object segmentation in videos.
